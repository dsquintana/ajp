  # 
  # The sign test as described in Thelwall et al., 2013 (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064841). This test compares a given publication against the publications that chronologically appeared immediately prior and after it. A "successful" test occurs when the number of tweet mentions and citations for a given publication are both higher (or both lower) than the average of tweets mentions and citations of the two adjacent articles. A "null" result can occur when comparisons with adjacent articles yield an equal score.
  # NA is used to code for "null"
  res <- rep(NA,length(score))
  for (n in 2:(length(score)-1))
  {
      comp <- (ref[n] - (ref[n+1]+ref[n-1])) * (score[n] - (score[n+1]+score[n-1]))
      if (comp > 0) {
          res[n] <- "success"      
      } else if ( comp < 0) {
          res[n] <- "fail"
      } else {
          res[n] <- NA
      }
  }
  return(res)
