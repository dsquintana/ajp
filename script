# Here we provide a companion script describing an analysis of a two-year sample of journal publications.
# This document contains the script used for downloading altmetrics data and performing the binomial test.
# The script assumes that the datafiles are located in the R working directory.

# The following line will clear all variables in your current RStudio working environment
rm(list = ls())

# Set your working directory
setwd("/Users/dsquintana/Dropbox/uio/projects/Twitter JAMA/AMJ/amj_analysis") # Replace this by the path of your working directory

# Source the functions used in this script
source("scripts/signTest.R") 
source("scripts/checkPackageInstall.R") 

# Load the required packages (install if needed)
packageVec <- c("ggplot2", "RColorBrewer", "scales", "cowplot", "rAltmetric", "plyr", "lubridate")
for (p in packageVec)

    checkPackageInstall(p)

#Scraping almetrics data. Note: You may need to split data scraping into smaller portions if you are being rate limited. See this page for more details - http://api.altmetric.com. Check the following for explanation of output: http://api.altmetric.com/docs/call_citations.html

# Read in Web of Science (WoS) data. Here we assume that the WoS data has been downloaded and saved as .csv file. The WoS file contains a list of all articles published in a journal over a given time period with DOIs and citations (among other data)
wos <- read.csv("data/dois_AJP.csv",header = T,sep=";",na.strings = "")
wos <- subset(wos,wos$DOI!="NA")
names(wos)[which(names(wos)=="DOI")] <- "doi"
wos$doi <- toupper(as.character(wos$doi))

# Get almetric data. This following script first checks if predownloaded file exists.

# Merge WoS and Almetric data

# Perform the sign test as described in Thelwall et al., 2013 (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064841). This test compares a given publication against the publications that chronologically appeared immediately prior and after it. A "successful" test occurs when the number of tweet mentions and citations for a given publication are both higher (or both lower) than the average of tweets mentions and citations of the two adjacent articles. A "null" result can occur when comparisons with adjacent articles yield an equal score. 
df$signTest <- signTest(ref = df$Total.Citations,score = df$cited_by_tweeters_count)

# Perform the binomial test
signTestRes <- as.data.frame(summary(as.factor(df$signTest)))
bt <- binom.test(c(signTestRes["success",],signTestRes["fail",])) 

(bt) # Prints the binomial test result

summary(as.factor(df$signTest)) # Prints a summary of the sign test
