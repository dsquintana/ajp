# Twitter Article Mentions and Citations

A companion R script implementing the analysis described in Quintana and Doan (under review). 

# Summary

Altmetrics have emerged as a novel measure of research impact. Indeed, many journals prominently display altmetric scores alongside publications to illustrate online attention. While previous work has shown that the number of article mentions on Twitter is associated with citations, research is yet to specifically evaluate the role of Twitter in assessing research impact in psychiatry. 

Here we provide a companion scriptwhere we describe an analysis of a two-year sample of Journal publications in the Journal.
